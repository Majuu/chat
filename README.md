## What and why
The aim of this project is to show my ability to develop an Angular project with websocket connection, animation feature and tests. 
It was one of my 2023 goals to tidy up my github profile and show my skills in various technologies.
Please do keep in mind, that this application is just an **example of my skills**, it does not show my whole knowledge.

## Main technologies
- Angular 15.2
- Firebase
- Cypress
- Karma + jasmine
- the rest can be looked up in `package.json` file

## Tests
The project includes unit tests (karma + jasmine) and e2e tests (cypress). On request I can share more details.

## About the project itself
This project is a tiny real time chat app. Thanks to the connection to firebase realtime database (via websocket) the application can react immediately to any changes (new logged in users or new messages). 

An additional thing worth mentioning is the animation that moves all the chat messages up whenever new message appears.

Do feel free to test the app by yourself (link above).

**Note:** to avoid any unwanted content, all the data from the database is deleted on every app launch.

## Final notes
This project has presentational purposes only. 

External usage of the project without permission prohibited.
